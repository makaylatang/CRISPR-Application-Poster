## Tunable Transcription Factor Based on CRISPR to Repress Hsp90

### Abstract

Heat shock protein can promote protein folding or complex assembly. I focus on the Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) because Hsp90 involves in the genetic buffering mechanism.Hsp90 can suppress (buffer) the effects of genetic variations, and thus it allows variations to accumulate without phenotypic consequences. However, when Hsp90 is inhibited, the hidden variations would reveal their effects. Based on this feature, we are able to observe the phenotype variation by inhibiting the Hsp90. The previous system to repress the Hsp90 level in our lab is using tet promoter, but I found out the doxycycline is very unstable. The cells, which were spotted separately on different days, grew different on the same batch of doxycycline plates. Therefore, I tried to construct another system to solve this problem. In my project, I developed the transcriptional regulation by CRISPR-based system to repress Hsp90. This system used mutation Cas9 which is endonuclease deficient (called dCas9).Furthermore, dCas9 acts together with guide RNAs to target the specific regions. Through the engineering of guide RNAs, dCas9 can bind different positions of HSP90 promoter, which blocking progression of RNA polymerase and hence silence expression of the targeted gene. By doing so, I tried to repress Hsp90-GFP expression in the yeast cells and test fluorescence per cell by flow cytometer to analysis the degree of repression among different dCas9 binding sites.
